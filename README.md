This repository contains a zip file containing the print files (in stl format) for the TissueTractor as published in Yang, J., Hearty, E., Wang, Y., Vijayraghavan, D. S., Walter, T., Anjum, S., Stuckenholz, C., Cheng, Y. W., Balasubramanian, S., Dong, Y. et al. (2025) 'The TissueTractor: A Device for Applying Large Strains to Tissues and Cells for Simultaneous High-Resolution Live Cell Microscopy', Small Methods 9(8): e2500136.

The TissueTractor is designed to be compatible with inverted confocal microscopy used for live-cell high resultion imaging. The TissueTractor enables simultaneous high-resolution spatiotemporal imaging of live cells and tissues under strain applications varying from 0% to over 100%.
